INTRO

jlschatterbox.com is a middle school project intended to be used as a way of chatting with friends, mainly for JLS middle school, but anybody can use this. There are codes that you could enter to join private chats made by us and also other users. Accounts are optional so that you aren't constantly bugged, but it is reccomended so that you can keep the codes that you entered. This project is HTML based with javascript. We used Node.js for the chat server itself.
